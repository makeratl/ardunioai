# ArduinoAI: AI-Enhanced LED Art Installations

## 🌟 Project Overview
This repository documents my journey of collaborating with AI to refactor and enhance custom LED art installations. Originally created as artistic lamp designs, these installations are being reimagined with sophisticated animations through AI assistance. The project serves two purposes:
1. Showcase how AI can enhance creative LED projects
2. Demonstrate practical AI integration into existing workflows

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Refactor existing LED installations with AI-generated animations
- Create complex, smooth, and dynamic lighting effects
- Document the AI-human collaboration process
- Share knowledge about integrating AI into creative workflows
- Provide educational resources for LED art creators

## 💡 Featured Installations

### BubbleGlassLamp
A sophisticated LED lamp featuring:
- 497 individually addressable LEDs
- Three distinct sections for complex animations
- Multiple animation modes including ocean, fire, and matrix effects
- Detailed documentation in `BubbleGlassLamp/cursorrules.md`

### GarageDoorDisplay
An innovative window display system with:
- 600 LEDs across two synchronized windows
- Mirrored animation capabilities
- Various effects from classic Cylon to water simulations
- Configuration details in `GarageDoorDisplay/cursorrules.md`

## 🤖 AI Collaboration
This project demonstrates how AI can:
- Generate complex LED animation patterns
- Optimize existing code for better performance
- Suggest improvements to lighting effects
- Help document and organize code
- Assist in troubleshooting and debugging
